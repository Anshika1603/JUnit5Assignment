# JUnit5Assignment

Question:
Create a JUnit 5 test class called "PersonTest". This test class should test the basic functionality of a simple Person class that has the following 
properties:

    name (String): the name of the person 
    age (int): the age of the person
    email (String): the email address of the person

In Test class, create Person object with any given params and test the getters against the params being passed to create Person object.

Your "PersonTest" class should have three test methods, one for each property. Each test method should test the following scenarios:

    Test the getter method for a non-null value
    Test the getter method for a null value

For the "age" property, you should also test the following scenarios:

    Test the setter method with a positive integer
    Test the setter method with a negative integer
    Test the setter method with zero

For each scenario, you should check that the correct value is returned by the getter method or set by the setter method. You should also add at least
one assertion for each scenario to ensure that the method is behaving correctly.
